# tetrix
`tetrix` **simplifies** the **customization** of **any environment**: *local development* environment, *CI/CD* environment and so on.<br>
`tetrix` is like a database that stores the values of all variables that can be customized and allows you to express some variables through others (aka **variable expansion**).<br>
Also `tetrix` provides a **template processor** that produces ready for use files (*configs*, *scripts* and others) filled with appropriate values.<br>
